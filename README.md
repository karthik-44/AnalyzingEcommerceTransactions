### Problem Context
In the fast-changing world of online shopping, our data whiz, Alex, embarked on an exciting journey.  
With Python and SQL as trusted companions, he explored a vast e-commerce dataset in three key phases: 
 - Data Cleanup
 - Cohort Analysis
 - SQL Insights.

**First phase - Data Cleanup with Python**  
Alex carefully combed through the dataset, fixing missing information and sorting out errors. He made sure the data was ready for the next steps.  

**Second phase - Cohort Analysis with Python**   
Alex grouped customers based on their shopping habits and timelines. This revealed secrets about customer loyalty and how people shop online, like deciphering a hidden code.  

**Final phase - SQL Insights**   
Using SQL, he found answers to important questions. SQL helped Alex find these answers, giving us a full picture of e-commerce questions we expect to find.  
With each line of code and every SQL query, Alex didn't just find answers; he paved the way for smarter decisions. This project wasn't just about numbers; it was about helping e-commerce thrive in a competitive world.  
Join us on this data-driven journey as we follow Alex's steps, revealing the secrets of online shopping success.
